    "**1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "* Excel spreadsheets have several advantages over CSV spreadsheets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Excel spreadsheets can contain multiple sheets within a single file, allowing for better organization and management of data.\n",
    "* Excel supports various formatting options such as cell colors, font styles, and conditional formatting, making it suitable for creating visually appealing and structured reports.\n",
    "* Excel provides built-in formulas and functions for performing calculations and data manipulation.\n",
    "* Excel supports the storage of complex data types, including dates, formulas, and charts.\n",
    "* Excel offers advanced features like data validation, sorting, filtering, and pivot tables for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "To create reader and writer objects using the **csv.reader() and csv.writer()** functions, you pass a File object as an argument. The File object should be opened in the appropriate mode for reading or writing CSV data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For reader objects:** The File object needs to be opened in text mode with the mode r or rt.\n",
    "* **For writer objects:** The File object needs to be opened in text mode with the mode w or wt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The **writerow()** method of the writer object is used to write a list of values as a row to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "* **delimiter:** The delimiter keyword argument specifies the character used to separate fields in a CSV file. By default, it is set to a comma (,), but you can customize it to any character that suits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **line terminator:** The line terminator keyword argument specifies the character sequence used to terminate lines in a CSV file. By default, it is set to '\\r\\n' (CRLF), but you can customize it to '\\n' (LF) or other line terminator sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The **json.loads()** function takes a string of JSON data as input and returns a Python data structure (e.g., a dictionary, list, string, number, boolean, or null) representing the parsed JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The **json.dumps()** function takes a Python data structure (e.g., a dictionary, list, string, number, boolean, or null) as input and returns a string of JSON data representing the serialized form of the data."
